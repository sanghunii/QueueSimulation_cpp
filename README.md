##Simulation program using queue

##<queue.h> is the queue interface header file for simulation, <queue.cpp> is the queue interface implementation file

##<queue_simulation.cpp> is simulation code

##Compile <queue.cpp> and <queue_simulation.cpp> together.

##For any particular queue length, what would you like the average wait time to be for your guests? How many customers should we receive per hour to meet that waiting time? Try this simulation

##The simulation can be applied to any queue, including movie theater queues, restaurant queues, amusement park queues, etc.
