##For any particular queue length, what would you like the average wait time to be for your guests? How many customers should we receive per hour to meet that waiting time? Try this simulation

##<queue.h> is the queue interface header file for simulation, <queue.cpp> is the queue interface implementation file

##<queue_simulation.cpp> is simulation code

##Compile <vect.cpp> and <randwalk_ver1.cpp> together.

##Through the program in <randwalk_ver2.cpp>, we can see that as the number of trials (number of experiments) increases, the average value converges to the theoretical value according to probability theory: (required number of steps) = (target distance / stride)^2
