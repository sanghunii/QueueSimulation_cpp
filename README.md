##Simulation program using queue

##<queue.h> is the queue interface header file for simulation, <queue.cpp> is the queue interface implementation file

##<queue_simulation.cpp> is simulation code

##Compile <queue.cpp> and <queue_simulation.cpp> together. & compile <queue.cpp> and <double_queue.cpp> together.

##For any particular queue length, what would you like the average wait time to be for your guests? How many customers should we receive per hour to meet that waiting time? Try this simulation

##The simulation can be applied to any queue, including movie theater queues, restaurant queues, amusement park queues, etc.

##Through two different versions of the simulation program, we can see that the number of queues and the number of customers that can be received per hour with limited waiting time do not have a linear relationship. In other words, doubling the length of the queue does not mean that the number of customers you can receive doubles.
